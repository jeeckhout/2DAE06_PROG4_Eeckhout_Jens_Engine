# 2DAE06_PROG4_Eeckhout_Jens_Engine
A barebones engine i made for one of my courses
Currently set up to only support basic 2D games
Certain components are made to work for digdug but can be altered for any other 2D game

For the digdug game, the white screen is not a bug i just dont have a main menu 
To start a game press A/1 for solo, B/2 for coop and X/3 for versus

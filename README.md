# 2DAE06_PROG4_Eeckhout_Jens_Engine
A barebones engine i made for one of my courses
Currently set up to only support basic 2D games
Inputmanager is compatible with both controllers and keyboard

This engine uses a component system to prevent potential issues with inheritance
Engine supports SDL_mixer so sound can be used
